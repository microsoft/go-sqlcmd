# Go-based SQL Utilities - Preview 

This repo contains command line tools and go packages for working with Microsoft SQL Server, Azure SQL Database, and Azure Synapse.

## Sqlcmd

The `sqlcmd` project aims to be a complete port of the native sqlcmd to the `go` language, utilizing the [go-mssqldb](https://github.com/microsoft/go-mssqldb) driver. For full documentation of the tool and installation instructions, see https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/tools/go-sqlcmd-utility

### Breaking changes

We will be implementing command line switches and behaviors over time. Several switches and behaviors are expected to change in this implementation.

- `-P` switch will be removed. Passwords for SQL authentication can only be provided through these mechanisms:

    - The `SQLCMDPASSWORD` environment variable
    - The `:CONNECT` command
    - When prompted, the user can type the password to complete a connection
- `-r` requires a 0 or 1 argument
- `-R` switch will be removed. The go runtime does not provide access to user locale information, and it's not readily available through syscall on all supported platforms.
- `-I` switch will be removed. To disable quoted identifier behavior, add `SET QUOTED IDENTIFIER OFF` in your scripts.
- `-N` now takes a string value that can be one of `true`, `false`, or `disable` to specify the encryption choice. (`default` is the same as omitting the parameter)
  - If `-N` and `-C` are not provided, sqlcmd will negotiate authentication with the server without validating the server certificate.
  - If `-N` is provided but `-C` is not, sqlcmd will require validation of the server certificate. Note that a `false` value for encryption could still lead to encryption of the login packet.
  - If both `-N` and `-C` are provided, sqlcmd will use their values for encryption negotiation.
  - More information about client/server encryption negotiation can be found at <https://docs.microsoft.com/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-tds/60f56408-0188-4cd5-8b90-25c6f2423868>
- `-u` The generated Unicode output file will have the UTF16 Little-Endian Byte-order mark (BOM) written to it.
- Some behaviors that were kept to maintain compatibility with `OSQL` may be changed, such as alignment of column headers for some data types.
- All commands must fit on one line, even `EXIT`. Interactive mode will not check for open parentheses or quotes for commands and prompt for successive lines. The ODBC sqlcmd allows the query run by `EXIT(query)` to span multiple lines.
- `-i` now requires multiple arguments for the switch to be separated by `,`.

### Miscellaneous enhancements

- `:Connect` now has an optional `-G` parameter to select one of the authentication methods for Azure SQL Database  - `SqlAuthentication`, `ActiveDirectoryDefault`, `ActiveDirectoryIntegrated`, `ActiveDirectoryServicePrincipal`, `ActiveDirectoryManagedIdentity`, `ActiveDirectoryPassword`. If `-G` is not provided, either Integrated security or SQL Authentication will be used, dependent on the presence of a `-U` user name parameter.
- The new `--driver-logging-level` command line parameter allows you to see traces from the `go-mssqldb` client driver. Use `64` to see all traces.
- Sqlcmd can now print results using a vertical format. Use the new `-F vertical` command line option to set it. It's also controlled by the `SQLCMDFORMAT` scripting variable.

### Azure Active Directory Authentication

This version of sqlcmd supports a broader range of AAD authentication models, based on the [azidentity package](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/sdk/azidentity). The implementation relies on an AAD Connector in the [driver](https://github.com/microsoft/go-mssqldb).

#### Command line

To use AAD auth, you can use one of two command line switches

`-G` is (mostly) compatible with its usage in the prior version of sqlcmd. If a user name and password are provided, it will authenticate using AAD Password authentication. If a user name is provided it will use AAD Interactive authentication which may display a web browser. If no user name or password is provided, it will use a DefaultAzureCredential which attempts to authenticate through a variety of mechanisms.

`--authentication-method=` can be used to specify one of the following authentication types.

`ActiveDirectoryDefault`

- For an overview of the types of authentication this mode will use, see (<https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/tree/main/sdk/azidentity#defaultazurecredential>).
- Choose this method if your database automation scripts are intended to run in both local development environments and in a production deployment in Azure. You'll be able to use a client secret or an Azure CLI login on your development environment and a managed identity or client secret on your production deployment without changing the script.
- Setting environment variables AZURE_TENANT_ID, and AZURE_CLIENT_ID are necessary for DefaultAzureCredential to begin checking the environment configuration and look for one of the following additional environment variables in order to authenticate:

  - Setting environment variable AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET configures the DefaultAzureCredential to choose ClientSecretCredential.
  - Setting environment variable AZURE_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE_PATH configures the DefaultAzureCredential to choose ClientCertificateCredential if AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET is not set.
  - Setting environment variable AZURE_USERNAME configures the DefaultAzureCredential to choose UsernamePasswordCredential if AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET and AZURE_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE_PATH are not set.

`ActiveDirectoryIntegrated`

This method is currently not implemented and will fall back to `ActiveDirectoryDefault`

`ActiveDirectoryPassword`

This method will authenticate using a user name and password. It will not work if MFA is required.
You provide the user name and password using the usual command line switches or SQLCMD environment variables.
Set `AZURE_TENANT_ID` environment variable to the tenant id of the server if not using the default tenant of the user.

`ActiveDirectoryInteractive`

This method will launch a web browser to authenticate the user.

`ActiveDirectoryManagedIdentity`

Use this method when running sqlcmd on an Azure VM that has either a system-assigned or user-assigned managed identity. If using a user-assigned managed identity, set the user name to the ID of the managed identity. If using a system-assigned identity, leave user name empty.

`ActiveDirectoryServicePrincipal`

This method authenticates the provided user name as a service principal id and the password as the client secret for the service principal. Provide a user name in the form `<service principal id>@<tenant id>`. Set `SQLCMDPASSWORD` variable to the client secret. If using a certificate instead of a client secret, set `AZURE_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE_PATH` environment variable to the path of the certificate file.

### Environment variables for AAD auth

Some settings for AAD auth do not have command line inputs, and some environment variables are consumed directly by the `azidentity` package used by `sqlcmd`.
These environment variables can be set to configure some aspects of AAD auth and to bypass default behaviors. In addition to the variables listed above, the following are sqlcmd-specific and apply to multiple methods.

`SQLCMDCLIENTID` - set this to the identifier of an application registered in your AAD which is authorized to authenticate to Azure SQL Database. Applies to `ActiveDirectoryInteractive` and `ActiveDirectoryPassword` methods.

### Packages

#### sqlcmd executable

Build [sqlcmd](cmd/sqlcmd)

```sh

go build ./cmd/sqlcmd

```

#### sqlcmd package

pkg/sqlcmd is consumable by other hosts. Go docs for the package are forthcoming. See the test code and [main.go](cmd/sqlcmd/main.go) for examples of initializing and running sqlcmd.

## Building

To add version data to your build using `go-winres`, add `GOBIN` to your `PATH` then use `go generate`
The version on the binary will match the version tag of the branch.

```sh

go install github.com/tc-hib/go-winres@latest
cd cmd/sqlcmd
go generate

```

Scripts to build the binaries and package them for release will be added in a build folder off the root. We will also add Azure Devops pipeline yml files there to initiate builds and releases. Until then just use `go build ./cmd/sqlcmd` to create a sqlcmd binary.

## Testing

The tests rely on SQLCMD scripting variables to provide the connection string parameters. Set SQLCMDSERVER, SQLCMDDATABASE, SQLCMDUSER, SQLCMDPASSWORD variables appropriately then

```sh

go test ./...

```

If you are developing on Windows, you can use docker or WSL to run the tests on Linux. `docker run` lets you pass the environment variables. For example, if your code is in `i:\git\go-sqlcmd` you can run tests in a docker container:

```cmd

docker run -rm -e SQLCMDSERVER=<yourserver> -e SQLCMDUSER=<youruser> -e SQLCMDPASSWORD=<yourpassword> -v i:\git\go-sqlcmd:/go-sqlcmd -w /go-sqlcmd golang:1.16 go test ./...

```
